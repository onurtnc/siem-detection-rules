### Splunk (SPL)

Two SPL queries are provided:

- `credential_exfiltration_http_post.spl`  
  Flags large HTTP POST requests to `.php` endpoints (common in stealer exfil).

- `credential_exfiltration_http_post_burst.spl`  
  Reduces false positives by requiring repeated POSTs or higher total bytes within a 10-minute window.

**Tuning tips:**
- Increase/decrease the `50000` byte threshold based on your environment
- Add allowlists for known upload services/domains
- Correlate with process telemetry (Sysmon/EDR) for higher confidence
